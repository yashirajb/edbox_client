        EdBoxes are boxes created for teachers to better meet the varying learning needs of students in their classroom. One struggle teachers consistently have is differentiating instruction that effectively responds to their learnerâ€™s unique academic needs. EdBoxes are an answer to this as they are carefully curated boxes that contain learning materials to support the learning needs of students at a below basic, proficient, or advanced academic level in grades K-6. With EdBoxes, below basic students have an opportunity to catch up, proficient students can continue to build solid grade-level skills, and advanced students can continue to engage in learning that is rigorous and engaging.
